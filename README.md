# Summergeeks : HealthPlus-Visitor-Management-System
A Visitor Management Web App made using Django.

This is a simple web application which can be used for managing meetings and visitor details. It can keep track of all the meetings and can send emails and sms to host and visitor about their meeting details.

Being a web application **It also serves as an organisation's official website** where other people can visit and get more information about the organisation.

#### This project is made by keeping a healthcare organisation in mind. Though it can be modified for any organisation.

#### Why i made it organisation specific?
Well !, as it also acts as an organisation's official website, so i took an example organisation. Also, its always better to explain with examples : )

## Check-Out Provision
Now, According to me, the best person who can be given the responsibility to checkout a visitor is the 'Host' itself.
#### Why Host ??
- If we give the checkout option openly on the dashboard, someone else may misuse the option and checkout for others.
- Assume we use a verification system for checkout on dashboard, it may happen that the visitor forget to checkout after leaving and as it requires verification, the Host will be shown as BUSY on dashboard for an unknown time.
- If we make the Checkout option manual, means the visitor is required to go to reception and ask for checkout, then also it may happen that visitor forget to visit reception after leaving. Also our system is made to be automatic and this will make it manual.
- **As Host is the only person involved in the meeting after visitor, and he also knows that exactly when the visitor left, he can be given the option to checkout visitor.**
#### How Host can Checkout Visitor ??
- As we know that when a visitor makes a Check-In, Host is informed about it via Email and SMS. **I have given the Check-out button for that visitor in the same Email sent to Host, and asked him to click that button when the meeting is over**. As soon as the meeting is over, Host clicks the Checkout button given in the mail, and checkout of visitor is completed. Checkout Time is recorded and an Email is sent to visitor. Also the **Host status is set as FREE**, that means Host is ready for next meeting.
- **Dashboard is capable to refresh itself after every 20 seconds(thanks to Meta refresh method!), so that any change in Host status is seen on the dashboard automatically.**

**Watch the demo video given above to Know, how it exactly works. Screeshots of Emails and SMS are given below.**

## Technology Stack
- Django - Backend
- HTML, CSS, Bootstrap - Frontend
- Sqlite3 - Database
- Jinja - Templating engine
- way2sms Message API (You can use any API of your choice!)

## Approach for developing backend
As there are two major things to store, which are host details and meeting/visitor details. I have created two models for it, named as :

- Host, with following fields:

    + id = `AutoField`
    + host_name = `CharField`
    + host_email = `EmailField`
    + host_phone = `IntegerField`
    + host_image = `ImageField`
    + host_desc = `CharField`
    + address = `CharField`
    + status = `BooleanField`
    + available = `CharField`
    + current_meeting_id = `IntegerField`

- Meeting, with following fields:

    + id = `AutoField`
    + visitor_name = `CharField`
    + visitor_email = `EmailField`
    + visitor_phone = `IntegerField`
    + host = `CharField`
    + date = `DateField`
    + time_in = `TimeField`
    + time_out = `TimeField`
    
These two models are connected using the meeting ID which is stored in both of them, during meeting the status of Host is set as BUSY and after the meeting is over, Host clicks the Checkout button given inside the Email. As the Checkout button is clicked, the meeting Id filled inside 'current_meeting_id' is deleted and Host's status is set to FREE. Also the checkout time is autofilled inside meeting details.

## Features
- Simple and easy to use GUI.
- Faster load speeds (thanks to Django!).
- Password secured admin panel/dashboard.
- Descriptive dashboard that shows all hosts with their images, details and status.
- Keeps track of all meetings and respective visitor details.
- Emails and SMS notification to both visitor and Host.
- Easy to ADD, DELETE or EDIT a host profile.

## Solution Workflow
Let a visitor wants to meet a host, he goes to reception and asks for the same. The receptionist/admin checks for the host on the dashboard. Dashboard shows information of all hosts with their current status. If they are busy it shows the current visitor details and gives a checkout option. If the host is free, admin fills the visitor details in the meeting form and clicks the check-in button. As the button is clicked, a mail and a sms is sent to host informing about visitor details. When the meeting is over, the visitor while going back asks the receptionist for the checkout. After check-out button is clicked, a mail with all details of meeting is sent to visitor's mail id.

## Local Machine development setup
- Clone the repository on your machine 
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/shubhamkumar27/Summergeeks-Visitor-Management-System.git
    ```
    
- Install all dependencies by executing the following command:
    ```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    
- You need to make some changes to the settings.py file inside visitor_management folder, go to bottom of the file
    ```
    UPDATE : EMAIL_HOST_USER = "your email id" 
    UPDATE : EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD = "your email id password"
    ```
    ( Make sure you <a href='https://myaccount.google.com/lesssecureapps'>enable less secure apps</a> in your google account, so that it sends email ! )
   
- Now you need to edit some lines in views.py file inside accounts folder
  - INSIDE email function:
    ```
    UPDATE : sender = 'your email id'
    ```
  - GO to <a href='https://www.way2sms.com/'>way2sms</a>, create your account and genetrate your test apikey and secret key. Now go INSIDE sendsms function:
    ```
    UPDATE : 'apikey':'your api key',
    UPDATE : 'secret':'your secret key',
    UPDATE : 'senderid' : 'your way2sms account email id'
    ```
    
- Now go inside the main folder which was cloned (manage.py file will be present there), now open a terminal in that directory and run follwing commands:
    ```
    python manage.py createsuperuser
    # follow further instruction there
    
    - After super user is created 
    python manage.py makemigrations
    python manage.py migrate
    
    python manage.py runserver
    ```
- Now server will start at - http://127.0.0.1:8000/
